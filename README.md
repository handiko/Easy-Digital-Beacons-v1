### Easy-Digital-Beacons-v1

A simple and easy WiFi-enabled ESP8266-powered WSPR, FT8, and FT4 beacon system
which uses NTP + DS3231 RTC for timing. Also, checkout our [cost-effective, and
robust HF 5W PA system](https://github.com/kholia/HF-PA-v5/).

It is also a WiFi-enabled VFO, which is quite useful, and convenient for radio
experimentation work.

Note: The whole project can be assembled on a breadboard (including the [250mW
amplifier](./QRPp-Amplifier)) in under 30 minutes - do give it a go ;)

The whole design is modular, parametric (cost and others), field repairable,
and super extensible. It is almost trivial to add support for more `beacon
modes`.


#### Build Steps

If you are using Windows OS, execute the following steps:

- Download this repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/kholia/Easy-Digital-Beacons-v1/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

- Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder.

- Run the `setup_arduino_ide.bat` file inside this folder.

- Install https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer library.

- Install https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTC library.

If you are on Linux, execute the following steps:

```
sudo apt-get install git  # install 'git' if needed

git clone https://github.com/kholia/Easy-Digital-Beacons-v1.git

make install_arduino_cli
make install_platform
make deps  # using Windows?, read the 'Makefile' file

cd ~/Arduino/libraries
git clone https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer.git
git clone https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP.git
```

Now execute these common steps:

Add your WiFi credentials in `Easy-Digital-Beacons-v4/credentials.h` file

Change the following lines in the code to use your values:

```
char message[] = "VU3CER VU3FOE MK68";
char call[] = "VU3FOE";
char loc[] = "MK68";
uint8_t dbm = 27;
```

[OPTIONAL] Change the following line in the code to suit your Si5351A module:

```
int32_t si5351CalibrationFactor =  ...
```

Use [this program](https://github.com/etherkit/Si5351Arduino/blob/master/examples/si5351_calibration/si5351_calibration.ino)
to derive the calibration value for your Si5351A module.

Follow [this tutorial first](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-web-server-spiffs-nodemcu/) to
get familiar with `SPIFFS` uploading stuff. Use the `Tools -> ESP8266 Sketch
Data Upload` option in the Arduino IDE to upload the webserver resources to
ESP8266. Note: The webserver resources are located in the `data` folder
inside the `Easy-Digital-Beacons-v4` sketch.

Open and upload the `Easy-Digital-Beacons-v4` sketch to ESP8266 using the
`Sketch -> Upload` option in the Arduino IDE.

You are all set for the next step - congrats!


#### Usage

Turn off the `SW1` switch, and reboot the beacon system. The beacon system now
connects to your WiFi, and then runs a web server.

This web server can be accessed at http://beacon.local URL typically.

Beacon's web interface:

![DEMO 2](./Web-Interface.png)

Use this web interface to configure the beacon. Please use the `NTP Sync`
option in this web interface to set the RTC time fairly correctly.

Now, turn on the `SW1` switch, and reboot the beacon system. The beacon system
is active now, and will TX as per the configuration.

TIP: Please use a local (or nearby) receiver to receive and decode the beacon
signals! This is important to ensure that your beacon is TX'ing correctly.

![Pinout 1](./images/esp8266-wemos-d1-mini-pinout.png)

Si5351A module is connected via I2C to pins D1 (SCL) and D2 (SDA) of the Wemos
D1 Mini board. Connect DS3231 similarly.

Here is the schematic for the `Easy-Digital-Beacons-v4` sketch:

#### Notes

Note 2 (March-2022): The `FT4` beacon is decently reliable now (all thanks to
Anupam).

Author: Dhiru Kholia (VU3CER) - https://www.qrz.com/db/VU3CER/

Author 2: Anupam Saikia - https://github.com/anupamsaikia

The `DT` timings are very nice with `NTP Sync`, `DS3231 RTC` and the optional
`time-delta hack`.

7W (or less) of HF RF power offers global communications coverage when
propagation is good:

on Zero-PCBs. The current PCB version is just a placeholder hack - more to come
soon!

#### Battery System Recommendation

I recommend using a LiFePo4 (LFP) battery which has good energy density and is
also priced decently well.

![32650 battery](./images/LFP-32650.jpg)

Use the LFP battery with a `1S LFP BMS`.

![1S LFP BMS](./images/LFP-BMS-1S.jpg)

The BMS' output can be connected directly to the 3.3v input of the ESP8266
module.


#### NTP (Time) Sync for FST4W-Antonio

In the Arduino IDE, select `Tools -> Serial Monitor`. In the `Serial Monitor`
send `s` character to ESP8266 to trigger the `NTP Time Sync` process.

![NTP Time Sync](./screenshots/NTP-Time-Sync.png)

Reboot ESP8266 to check if RTC is retaining the correct time. If not, change
the RTC battery.


#### Power Notes

This will need a HF RF PA in most cases to be usable on the air.

UPDATE (May 2022): Checkout our [cost-effective, and robust HF PA system](https://github.com/kholia/HF-PA-v6/).

You can also start with the easy-to-build and breadboard-friendly [QRPp-Amplifier](./QRPp-Amplifier).


#### Relay Usage

We use a 2-channel relay as a `T/R switch`.

See https://github.com/kholia/Simple-TR-Switch for details.

Also check out https://github.com/kholia/Easy-Transceiver project.

#### BOM Sources

- https://robu.in/

#### Tips

Useful commands:

```
pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=Virtual0
pacmd update-sink-proplist Virtual0 device.description=Virtual0
pacmd update-source-proplist Virtual0.monitor device.description=Virtual0
```

Use Gqrx and WSJT-X with a SDR device for initial frequency adjustment /
calibration. This is essential for WSPR functionality. FT8 is more
robust/tolerant of frequency deviations due to a much larger RX window.

Note: To customize the FST4W beacon to use your callsign and grid, use the
following commands to generate the `FST4Wsymbols` array data.

```
fst4sim.exe "IK1HGI JN45 20" 60 1500 0.0 0.1 1.0 10 -15 F > message.txt

message2array.exe message.txt
```

Replace the original `FST4Wsymbols` array data with the output of
`message2array.exe` program.


#### Future Tasks

- Change Si5351 calibration factor from the Web UI

- Add support for custom FT8 / FT4 messages

- Re-announce mDNS stuff [LP]

- EEPROM - save TX interval / schedule [LP]

- Reset to defaults button [LP]
